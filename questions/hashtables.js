		question: "What are the best case and worst case runtimes for the insert() operation in a hashtable with separate chaining? You may assume that the hash table allows for duplicate values to be inserted. All answers should be tight bounds.",

		explanation: "You may assume the hashtable allows for duplicate values; bc can assume, you can insert at the head of the linked list in constant time"
