			{text: 'True', correct: false},
			{text: 'False', correct: true},
			{text: '', correct: false},
			{text: '', correct: false}
		],
		correctAnswer: '\"False\"',
		explanation: "While hash tables typically involve a fast look-up, they do take up memory (an array) which is not all used."

		question: "True or false: Hash functions need to be fast for the hash table to work correctly",

			{text: 'True', correct: false},
			{text: 'False', correct: true},
			{text: '', correct: false},
			{text: '', correct: false}

		correctAnswer: '\"False\"',
		explanation: "Needs to be fast for it to be fast, but collisions can slow it down while still working correctly."

		question: "What are the best case and worst case runtimes for the insert() operation in a hashtable with separate chaining? You may assume that the hash table allows for duplicate values to be inserted. All answers should be tight bounds.",

			{text: 'Best: O(1); Worst: O(1)', correct: true}
		],
		correctAnswer: '\"Best: O(1); Worst: O(1)\"',
		explanation: "You may assume the hashtable allows for duplicate values; becuase of this, you can insert at the head of the linked list in constant time"

		question: "Which of these changes to a hashtable implementation would not speed it up and is most likely to actually slow down the runtime?",

			{text: '68', correct: false},

		question: "Which of the following is the least recommended technique to improve hash table performance (even if it is effective, it has at least one major drawback)?",
		image: null,
		answers: [
			{text: 'Making the hash function generally return larger values that overflow', correct: false}, //not 100% sure what this is referring to (pulled this one from a site)
			{text: 'Using the separate chaining method', correct: false},
			{text: 'Using uniform hashing (i.e., making hash function spread the keys out better)', correct: false},
			{text: 'Increasing the hash table size to a large value', correct: true}
		],
		correctAnswer: '\"increasing the hash table size\"',
		explanation: "when increasing the hash table size, the space complexity will increase as we need to reallocate the memory size of hash table for every collision. Therefore it's not the best technique to avoid collisions. Instead, we can avoid collisions by making the hash function better, using the chaining methods and uniform hashing."

			{text: 'Circular linked list', correct: false},

		],
		correctAnswer: '\"Singly linked lsit\"',
		explanation: "Singly linked list saves space, but still has constant time insert at head."

		correctAnswer: '\"O(n)\"',
		explanation: "It is still possible that collisions force you to probe through all n items already present in the table before finding an available slot"
